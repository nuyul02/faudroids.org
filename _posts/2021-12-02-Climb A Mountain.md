title: What Equipment Do You Need To Climb A Mountain? 

---


![Image]({{ site.base.url }}/images/Climb A Mountain.jpg)

I have recently decided that I want to try out a more “serious” form of mountain climbing. I wanted to go beyond my regular hiking and trekking. So I decided to learn more about technical climbing and mountaineering.

But as I was figuring out the gear and equipment I need, it became a bit overwhelming. When do I need a piece of certain equipment or tool? Why are there so many variations and how do I know which one I need?

So if you are struggling with these same issues, I hope this article can help you out. I have summarized the research I did into a series of comparison tables. This can give you a quick overview of the equipment you need to climb a mountain

What Type Of Mountain Climbing Will You Be Doing?

Climbing a mountain is a very broad term that can mean many different things.

Before we can figure out the equipment we need, it is useful to look at the different types of mountain climbing. Each of them will need different specialized climbing tools.

There are many different categories and types of mountain climbing. For the purpose of this article, I will simplify them into the following broad categories:

* Rock climbing: this means using your hands and feet to climb up a vertical rock surface. May not include an ascent to the summit of a mountain.
* Ice climbing: this means using your hands and feet to climb up a vertical rock surface. May not include an ascent to the summit of a mountain.
* Mountaineering: climbing with the goal of reaching the summit of a mountain. May includes rock climbing or ice climbing or both. Mountaineering may sometimes be non technical and no extra equipment is required.

List of Climbing Equipment

1. Hiking Sticks or Poles
You need hiking sticks or poles for:

How to choose the type of hiking sticks or poles:

Quantity Depending on your preference, you can use 1 or 2 hiking sticks. Shaft Material Aluminum is durable and less costly.

Carbon composite is lighter, less durable and more costly.

Wooden sticks are cheap but do not come with any of the features mentioned here.

Grip Material Cork and foam are useful for sweaty hands.

Rubber is a better insulator for cold temperatures. But you may get blisters if you have sweaty hands.

Length Some sticks have adjustable lengths. This is useful as you use different lengths when going uphill and downhill.

Highly recommended to get sticks with adjustable lengths.

Locking mechanism Sticks with adjustable lengths have different locking mechanisms. Look for one that you are comfortable with. Shock absorption Some sticks have shock absorption capability. This helps support your hips and legs when going downhill. Tip A sharp tip is useful to get traction on trails and icy surfaces.

A rubber tip is useful on hard surfaces (e.g. rocks). This protects your stick and the environment.

Some hiking sticks come with both a sharp tip and a rubber cover that you can use interchangeably.

Wrist straps Straps help to support your hands when gripping.

Some sticks have straps that may be for right or left hands only.

Things to look out for:

* To adjust your hiking sticks to the correct length, hold the grip and bend your elbow at 90 degrees. The tip should be just touching the ground.

Typical lifespan:

Range A wider range is better. But the actual range depends on the orientations of the transceivers in use. Display screen This displays the location of the trapped climbers. Save mode Some transceivers allow you to save the location of various trapped climbers. Audio Some transceivers offer audio guidance. Things to look out for:

* Check that all transceivers transmit and receive electronic signals using the same frequency.
* Always run a test beforehand to ensure every transmitter in your group can send and receive signals from one another. Check for compatibility across brands and models.
* They are sometimes sold in a set with other rescue items such as snow shovel and snow probe. These might be cheaper than if you were to buy the items separately.

Typical lifespan:

* Can last forever.
* You can consider replacing your transceiver if new models have better detection capabilities. Or if they come with additional useful features.

Average cost:

* USD 250 to USD 350 for a mid-range option.

18. Snow Probe
Image source A snow probe is a stick used to locate climbers trapped in an avalanche. After locating the trapped climber via the transceiver, you use the snow probe to poke into the snow. This helps to pinpoint the exact location of the climber before digging.

You need snow probes are needed for:

* Ice climbing
* Mountaineering in icy terrains

How to choose the type of snow probe:

Material Typically aluminum or carbon.

Aluminum is usually heavier but can penetrate dense snow. Usually cheaper.

Carbon is lighter but less tough. Usually more costly.

Length It should be a minimum of 6.5 feet (2 meters).

The recommended length is between 8 and 10 feet (2.4 to 3 meters).

A longer probe is less tiring when probing in deep snow. A longer probe gives you more space to grip it which makes it less likely for you to break the probe.

Ease of use Some snow probes can be broken up into sections when not in use (like tent poles).

Check that the mechanism to assemble the snow probe for use is easy and intuitive.

Typical lifespan:

* Can last forever.
* Check for any damages before using e.g. corrosion, bent components

Quantity needed:

* 1 per person.
* You should not share your snow probe with other climbers. The person carrying the probe may be the one trapped.

Average cost:

* USD 40 to USD 60 for a mid-range option.

Accessories you may also need:

* Storage bag or wrap: to store the snow probe

19. Snow Shovel
A snow shovel is used to:

* Extract climbers trapped by an avalanche.
* Dig into snow to check the conditions underground and assess the risks.
* Level the grounds for setting up camp.
* Dig a shelter during an emergency.

You need snow shovels for:

* Ice climbing
* Mountaineering in icy terrains

How to choose the type of:

Material Typically aluminum which is light, strong and durable. Blade size A large blade can dig through more snow but requires more strength and tires you out faster.

A smaller blade allows you to dig faster and longer.

Blade edge Can be smooth or serrated. A serrated edge helps to cut out ice. Grip shape Can be a T, D or L shaped grip.

A T-shaped grip is light but might be difficult to use with some gloves.

A D-shaped grip is usually heavier but easy to use.

A T-shaped grip is light and easy to use.

Other things to look out for:

* Some snow shovels have an adjustable shaft length.
* They are sometimes sold in a set with other rescue items such as avalanche transceiver and snow probe. These might be cheaper than if you were to buy the items separately.

Typical lifespan:

* Can last forever.
* Check for any damages before using e.g. excessive corrosion, loose components, damaged grip or blade which makes it difficult to use.

Quantity needed:

* 1 per person.
* You should not share your snow shovel with other climbers. The person carrying the shovel may be the one trapped.

Average cost:

* USD 30 to USD 50 for a mid-range option.

Accessories you may also need:

* Storage bags or covers: to cover the sharp ends of your snow shovel and prevent them from damaging your other gear
